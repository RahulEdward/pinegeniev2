### 3. Position Sizing Calculator
Advanced position sizing based on:
- **Account Balance**: Total available capital
- **Risk Per Trade**: Percentage of account to risk
- **Stop Loss Distance**: Distance to stop loss level
- **Market Volatility**: Current market volatility (ATR-based)
- **Confidence Level**: Confidence in the trade setup
- **Correlation Factor**: Correlation with existing positions

### 4. Risk-Reward Analysis
- **Ratio Calculation**: Automatic risk-reward ratio calculation
- **Probability Estimation**: Estimated probability of success
- **Expected Value**: Expected value of the trade
- **Recommendations**: Quality assessment (excellent, good, acceptable, poor, unacceptable)

### 5. Component Suggestions
- **Missing Required Components**: Critical components needed for safety
- **Recommended Additions**: Components to improve performance

- **Implementation Guidance**: How to implement suggested components

## Usage Examples

### Basic Risk Assessment

```typescript
import { RiskManagementEngine, StrategyType } from '../risk-rules';

const riskEngine = new RiskManagementEngine();

const assessment = riskEngine.assessRisk(StrategyType.TREND_FOLLOWING, {
  accountBalance: 10000,
  proposedPositionSize: 500,
  stopLossDistance: 2,
  currentDrawdown: 5,
  marketVolatility: 1.2
});

console.log('Overall Risk:', assessment.overallRisk);
console.log('Risk Score:', assessment.riskScore);
console.log('Recommendations:', assessment.recommendations);
```

### Position Sizing Calculation

```typescript
const positionSize = riskEngine.calculatePositionSize({
  accountBalance: 10000,
  riskPerTrade: 2, // 2% risk per trade
  stopLossDistance: 2, // 2% stop loss
  volatility: 1.5, // 1.5x normal volatility
  confidence: 0.8, // 80% confidence
  correlationFactor: 0.3 // 30% correlation with existing positions
});

console.log('Recommended Size:', positionSize.recommendedSize);
console.log('Reasoning:', positionSize.reasoning);
```

### Risk-Reward Ratio Analysis

```typescript
const rrRatio = riskEngine.calculateRiskRewardRatio(
  100, // Entry price
  98,  // Stop loss
  104  // Take profit
);

console.log('Risk-Reward Ratio:', rrRatio.ratio);
console.log('Recommendation:', rrRatio.recommendation);
console.log('Expected Value:', rrRatio.expectedValue);
```

### Component Suggestions

```typescript
const suggestions = riskEngine.suggestRiskComponents(
  StrategyType.MEAN_REVERSION,
  ['data_source', 'oscillator'] // Existing components
);

suggestions.forEach(suggestion => {
  console.log(`${suggestion.priority}: ${suggestion.description}`);
  console.log(`Implementation: ${suggestion.implementation}`);
});
```

### Strategy Completeness Assessment

```typescript
const completeness = riskEngine.assessStrategyCompleteness(
  StrategyType.BREAKOUT,
  ['data_source', 'support_resistance', 'breakout_condition']
);

console.log('Completeness:', completeness.completeness + '%');
console.log('Missing Required:', completeness.missingRequired);
console.log('Risk Level:', completeness.riskLevel);
```

## Strategy-Specific Risk Profiles
