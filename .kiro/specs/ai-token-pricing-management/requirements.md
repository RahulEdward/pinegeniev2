# AI Token and Pricing Management System Requirements

## Introduction

The AI Token and Pricing Management System extends the existing PineGenie admin dashboard with four new critical management sections: AI Token Management, Dynamic Pricing Management, Promotional Offers & Discounts, and Pricing Plan Content Management. This system integrates seamlessly with the existing admin infrastructure while adding powerful new capabilities for managing monetization and AI resource allocation without requiring code deployments.

**Note: This system will NOT modify or interfere with existing admin features including AI Control, Models, API Keys, Settings, Users, Analytics, or Security sections.**
