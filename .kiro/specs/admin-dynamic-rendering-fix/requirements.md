# Admin Dynamic Rendering Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The admin dashboard pages are currently causing build errors due to dynamic server usage when trying to render statically. Pages that use authentication cookies need to be properly configured for dynamic rendering to prevent build failures and ensure proper functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Dynamic Server Usage Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to complete without dynamic server usage errors, so that the application can be deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN admin pages using cookies SHALL be configured for dynamic rendering
2. WHEN admin pages are accessed THEN they SHALL properly handle authentication without static generation conflicts
3. WHEN the build completes THEN there SHALL be no dynamic server usage errors for admin routes

### Requirement 2: Maintain Admin Authentication Functionality

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to access protected admin pages with proper authentication, so that the security of the admin dashboard is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses protected routes THEN authentication SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN cookies are used for admin sessions THEN they SHALL be handled properly in dynamic rendering
3. WHEN admin pages load THEN they SHALL display correct authentication state

### Requirement 3: Optimize Build Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be efficient and only render pages dynamically when necessary, so that build times are optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages don't require dynamic features THEN they SHALL be statically generated
2. WHEN pages require cookies or server-side features THEN they SHALL be marked for dynamic rendering
3. WHEN the build runs THEN it SHALL complete successfully with appropriate rendering strategies

### Requirement 4: Ensure Proper Route Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all admin routes to be properly configured for their rendering requirements, so that the application behaves consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin routes use server-side features THEN they SHALL be explicitly marked as dynamic
2. WHEN routes can be static THEN they SHALL remain static for performance
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all routes SHALL have appropriate rendering configuration
