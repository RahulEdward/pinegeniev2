# Requirements Document

## Introduction

PineGenie AI is a revolutionary custom intelligence system designed to transform how users interact with our Next.js PineScript visual builder application. The system will eliminate the learning curve for new users by providing an intelligent assistant that can interpret natural language trading requests and automatically construct complete, professional-grade trading strategies through automated node placement and connection. The AI will be built entirely with custom JavaScript logic (no external AI models or APIs), ensuring fast response times, complete control over functionality, and seamless integration with our existing infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a novice trader, I want to describe my trading strategy in plain English, so that the AI can automatically build the complete visual strategy for me without requiring knowledge of node connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a natural language trading request THEN the system SHALL parse the request and identify key trading components (indicators, conditions, actions)
2. WHEN the parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically place the appropriate nodes on the canvas in logical positions
3. WHEN nodes are placed THEN the system SHALL automatically create connections between nodes based on trading logic flow
4. WHEN the strategy is built THEN the system SHALL generate valid PineScript v6 code that matches the user's intent
5. IF the user request is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions before proceeding with strategy construction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a professional trader, I want the AI to optimize my strategy parameters and suggest improvements, so that I can enhance my trading performance with minimal manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a strategy is created THEN the system SHALL analyze the strategy components and suggest optimal parameter values
2. WHEN parameter optimization is requested THEN the system SHALL provide multiple parameter sets with explanations for different market conditions
3. WHEN risk management is incomplete THEN the system SHALL automatically add appropriate stop-loss and take-profit nodes
4. WHEN the strategy lacks proper signal validation THEN the system SHALL suggest additional confirmation indicators
5. IF multiple optimization options exist THEN the system SHALL present them with clear explanations of trade-offs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user learning trading strategies, I want to see step-by-step visual animations of how my strategy is being built, so that I can understand the logic and learn for future strategy creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI begins building a strategy THEN the system SHALL display animated node placement with explanatory text
2. WHEN each node is placed THEN the system SHALL explain why that specific indicator or condition is being used
3. WHEN connections are made THEN the system SHALL animate the connection process and explain the data flow
4. WHEN the strategy is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of the strategy logic and expected behavior
5. IF the user wants to replay the explanation THEN the system SHALL allow rewatching the construction animation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with an existing partial strategy, I want the AI to analyze my current nodes and suggest completions or improvements, so that I can enhance my strategy without starting over.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has existing nodes on the canvas THEN the system SHALL analyze the current strategy structure
2. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL identify missing components (entry/exit signals, risk management)
3. WHEN improvements are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest specific nodes to add with positioning recommendations
4. WHEN the user accepts suggestions THEN the system SHALL automatically place and connect the recommended nodes
5. IF the existing strategy has errors THEN the system SHALL identify and offer to fix connection or logic issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to provide real-time feedback as I manually build strategies, so that I can avoid common mistakes and learn best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user places a node manually THEN the system SHALL provide contextual suggestions for the next logical step
2. WHEN a user creates a connection THEN the system SHALL validate the connection and warn of potential issues
3. WHEN a strategy component is missing THEN the system SHALL highlight the gap and suggest solutions
4. WHEN best practices are violated THEN the system SHALL provide educational tooltips explaining proper trading logic
5. IF the user ignores suggestions THEN the system SHALL still allow manual control while maintaining warnings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a library of pre-built strategy templates that the AI can customize based on my preferences, so that I can quickly start with proven strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests strategy templates THEN the system SHALL display categorized templates (trend-following, mean-reversion, etc.)
2. WHEN a template is selected THEN the system SHALL ask for customization preferences (timeframe, risk tolerance, instruments)
3. WHEN customization parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL modify the template nodes and parameters accordingly
4. WHEN the customized strategy is built THEN the system SHALL explain the modifications made and their impact
5. IF the user wants to save custom templates THEN the system SHALL allow saving personalized strategy blueprints

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to integrate seamlessly with the existing visual builder interface, so that I can switch between AI-assisted and manual building modes without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI mode is activated THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing builder functionality (zoom, pan, theme switching)
2. WHEN switching between AI and manual modes THEN the system SHALL preserve the current canvas state and node positions
3. WHEN the AI makes changes THEN the system SHALL support undo/redo operations for AI-generated modifications
4. WHEN the user manually modifies AI-generated strategies THEN the system SHALL seamlessly integrate manual changes
5. IF conflicts arise between AI and manual changes THEN the system SHALL prioritize user manual input while providing warnings

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI system to work entirely offline with fast response times, so that I can build strategies without internet dependency or delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI processes requests THEN the system SHALL respond within 500ms for simple strategies and 2 seconds for complex ones
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL initialize all AI logic without requiring external API calls
3. WHEN processing natural language THEN the system SHALL use local JavaScript-based parsing without external NLP services
4. WHEN generating strategies THEN the system SHALL use local knowledge base and rule engine for decision making
5. IF the system encounters processing errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
