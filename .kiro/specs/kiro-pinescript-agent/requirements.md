# Kiro-Style Pine Script Agent Requirements

## Introduction

This feature will create a Kiro-style AI agent specifically designed for Pine Script generation and trading strategy development. The agent will integrate seamlessly with the existing PineGenie dashboard while providing enhanced conversational AI capabilities, voice integration, and automated code generation with validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Theme Integration and UI Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Pine Script agent to match the existing dashboard design, so that it feels like a natural extension of the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent interface loads THEN the system SHALL use consistent color variables from the existing dashboard theme
2. WHEN users interact with the agent THEN the system SHALL display Kiro-style welcome cards and UI components
3. WHEN the interface adapts to different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design consistency
4. WHEN theme colors are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically reflect changes through the theme adapter
5. WHEN users navigate between agent and dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide seamless visual continuity

### Requirement 2: Core Pine Script Generation

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to describe my strategy in natural language and receive working Pine Script code, so that I can quickly implement trading ideas without coding knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes a trading strategy THEN the system SHALL generate syntactically correct Pine Script v6 code
2. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL validate syntax and provide error handling
3. WHEN users request modifications THEN the system SHALL update the generated code accordingly
4. WHEN complex strategies are requested THEN the system SHALL use appropriate templates and indicators
5. WHEN code validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggestions

### Requirement 3: Conversational Agent Behavior

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have multi-step conversations with the agent about my trading strategies, so that I can iteratively refine and improve my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users start a conversation THEN the system SHALL maintain context throughout the session
2. WHEN users ask follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL reference previous conversation history
3. WHEN users request changes THEN the system SHALL track progress and provide step-by-step guidance
4. WHEN conversations become complex THEN the system SHALL break down tasks into manageable steps
5. WHEN users return to previous conversations THEN the system SHALL restore context and continue seamlessly

### Requirement 4: Voice Integration

**User Story:** As a busy trader, I want to interact with the agent using voice commands, so that I can create strategies hands-free while monitoring markets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users activate voice mode THEN the system SHALL accurately convert speech to text for trading terminology
2. WHEN voice commands are processed THEN the system SHALL provide audio feedback and confirmations
3. WHEN users speak trading concepts THEN the system SHALL recognize specialized vocabulary and jargon
4. WHEN voice input is unclear THEN the system SHALL request clarification through audio prompts
5. WHEN users prefer text input THEN the system SHALL seamlessly switch between voice and text modes

### Requirement 5: Agent Hooks and Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated hooks that validate and enhance generated code, so that the output is always production-ready and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically validate Pine Script syntax and logic
2. WHEN risk management is missing THEN the system SHALL inject appropriate risk controls
3. WHEN code lacks documentation THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive comments and explanations
4. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest optimizations automatically
5. WHEN code is finalized THEN the system SHALL run all validation hooks before presenting to the user

### Requirement 6: Advanced UI Components

**User Story:** As a user, I want rich visual components that help me understand and interact with generated code, so that I can make informed decisions about my strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL display syntax-highlighted preview with proper formatting
2. WHEN users configure strategies THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive forms with validation
3. WHEN code is ready for export THEN the system SHALL offer multiple export options and formats
4. WHEN users want to preview results THEN the system SHALL show scanner table previews with sample data
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic code sections with helpful tooltips

### Requirement 7: Database Integration and Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversations and generated strategies to be saved automatically, so that I can return to previous work and build upon it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the agent THEN the system SHALL save conversation history to the database
2. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL store versions with timestamps and metadata
3. WHEN users create multiple strategies THEN the system SHALL organize them with proper categorization
4. WHEN users search for previous work THEN the system SHALL provide fast retrieval with filtering options
5. WHEN data needs to be backed up THEN the system SHALL ensure all agent interactions are properly persisted

### Requirement 8: LLM Integration and Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust LLM integration with proper error handling and fallbacks, so that the agent remains reliable even when external services have issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent processes requests THEN the system SHALL use appropriate LLM models for different task types
2. WHEN LLM services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallbacks and user notifications
3. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL validate output quality and relevance
4. WHEN usage limits are approached THEN the system SHALL manage requests efficiently and notify users
5. WHEN new LLM capabilities become available THEN the system SHALL be easily extensible to incorporate them
