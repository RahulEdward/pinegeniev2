# Pine Genie Signature Auto Add Feature - Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the Pine Genie signature auto-add feature into discrete, manageable coding tasks that build incrementally toward a complete signature system.

## Prerequisites

**IMPORTANT**: This feature requires the PayU Payment Integration to be completed first, as signature customization features are tied to subscription plans.
