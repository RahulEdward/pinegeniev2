# Pine Genie Signature Auto Add Feature - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will automatically add Pine Genie signatures and branding to all generated Pine Script code. The signature system will provide professional branding, attribution, and metadata information in generated scripts while maintaining Pine Script v6 compatibility and not interfering with script functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic Signature Integration

**User Story:** As a Pine Genie user, I want all generated Pine Script code to automatically include Pine Genie signatures, so that the scripts are properly branded and attributed to Pine Genie.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Pine Script code is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically include a Pine Genie signature header
2. WHEN code is generated from templates THEN the signature SHALL be inserted without breaking existing template functionality
3. WHEN code is generated from the visual builder THEN the signature SHALL be integrated seamlessly
4. WHEN signatures are added THEN they SHALL NOT interfere with Pine Script execution or compilation
5. WHEN signatures are added THEN they SHALL be formatted as Pine Script comments

### Requirement 2: Configurable Signature Content

**User Story:** As a Pine Genie administrator, I want to configure the signature content and format, so that I can control branding and attribution information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring signatures THEN the system SHALL support customizable signature templates
2. WHEN signature content is updated THEN all new generated scripts SHALL use the updated signature
3. WHEN signatures include dynamic content THEN the system SHALL support variables like date, version, and user information
4. WHEN signatures are configured THEN they SHALL include Pine Genie branding and website information
5. WHEN signatures are configured THEN they SHALL include generation timestamp and metadata

### Requirement 3: Multiple Signature Formats

**User Story:** As a Pine Genie user, I want different signature formats for different types of generated code, so that signatures are appropriate for the context (templates vs builder vs AI-generated).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating code from templates THEN the system SHALL use template-specific signature format
2. WHEN generating code from visual builder THEN the system SHALL use builder-specific signature format
3. WHEN generating code from AI chat THEN the system SHALL use AI-specific signature format
4. WHEN using different signature formats THEN each SHALL maintain consistent Pine Genie branding
5. WHEN signature formats differ THEN they SHALL all include core attribution information

### Requirement 4: Signature Positioning Control

**User Story:** As a Pine Genie user, I want signatures to be positioned appropriately in the generated code, so that they don't interfere with code readability or functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding signatures THEN they SHALL be placed at the top of the script as header comments
2. WHEN signatures are added THEN they SHALL be placed before the //@version declaration
3. WHEN signatures include multiple sections THEN they SHALL be properly formatted with separators
4. WHEN signatures are positioned THEN they SHALL maintain proper Pine Script comment syntax
5. WHEN signatures are added THEN they SHALL not exceed Pine Script comment length limits

### Requirement 5: User Preference Controls

**User Story:** As a Pine Genie user, I want to control signature inclusion preferences, so that I can customize the branding level according to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing signature settings THEN users SHALL be able to enable/disable signature inclusion
2. WHEN signature settings are disabled THEN generated code SHALL not include signatures
3. WHEN signature settings are enabled THEN users SHALL be able to choose signature verbosity levels
4. WHEN users have premium accounts THEN they SHALL have additional signature customization options
5. WHEN signature preferences are saved THEN they SHALL persist across user sessions

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a Pine Genie user, I want existing generated scripts to remain functional, so that signature addition doesn't break previously generated code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN signatures are added to new code THEN existing generated scripts SHALL remain unaffected
2. WHEN signature system is updated THEN it SHALL not modify previously generated scripts
3. WHEN users regenerate existing strategies THEN they SHALL receive updated signatures
4. WHEN signature format changes THEN old signatures SHALL remain valid Pine Script comments
5. WHEN signature system is disabled THEN it SHALL not affect existing scripts with signatures

### Requirement 7: Performance and Efficiency

**User Story:** As a Pine Genie user, I want signature addition to be fast and efficient, so that it doesn't slow down code generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN signatures are added THEN the process SHALL add less than 100ms to generation time
2. WHEN multiple scripts are generated THEN signature addition SHALL not cause memory leaks
3. WHEN signature templates are loaded THEN they SHALL be cached for performance
4. WHEN signature content is dynamic THEN variable resolution SHALL be optimized
5. WHEN signature system is active THEN it SHALL not impact overall application performance

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a Pine Genie developer, I want the signature system to integrate seamlessly with existing code generation systems, so that implementation is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with template system THEN signatures SHALL work with all existing templates
2. WHEN integrating with visual builder THEN signatures SHALL work with the enhanced Pine Script generator
3. WHEN integrating with AI chat THEN signatures SHALL work with LLM-generated code
4. WHEN signature system is added THEN it SHALL not require changes to core generation logic
5. WHEN signature system is implemented THEN it SHALL follow existing code architecture patterns
