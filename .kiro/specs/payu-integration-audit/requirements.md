# PayU Payment Integration Audit - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for auditing and improving the existing PayU payment integration in the PineGenie application. The audit will systematically check all components of the PayU integration to identify potential issues, security vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration and Environment Audit

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure PayU configuration is properly set up and secure, so that payments can be processed reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking PayU configuration THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
2. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL use production PayU endpoints and credentials
3. WHEN in test mode THEN the system SHALL use test PayU endpoints and credentials
4. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN validating merchant credentials THEN the system SHALL verify they are properly formatted

### Requirement 2: Payment Flow Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the payment process to work seamlessly from initiation to completion, so that I can successfully purchase subscriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a payment request THEN the system SHALL generate valid PayU form data with correct hash
2. WHEN redirecting to PayU THEN the system SHALL include all required parameters
3. WHEN PayU redirects back THEN the system SHALL properly handle success and failure scenarios
4. WHEN processing webhooks THEN the system SHALL validate signatures and update payment status
5. IF payment fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users

### Requirement 3: Security and Hash Validation

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want all PayU communications to be properly secured and validated, so that the payment system is protected from tampering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating payment hash THEN the system SHALL use the correct PayU hash formula
2. WHEN receiving webhook responses THEN the system SHALL verify response hash signatures
3. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt or properly secure payment information
4. IF hash validation fails THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction and log the security event
5. WHEN handling customer data THEN the system SHALL comply with data protection requirements

### Requirement 4: Database Integration and Data Consistency

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want payment data to be consistently stored and tracked, so that I can monitor transactions and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating payments THEN the system SHALL store all relevant payment information in the database
2. WHEN updating payment status THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency across related models
3. WHEN processing webhooks THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate processing of the same event
4. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and maintain data integrity
5. WHEN generating invoices THEN the system SHALL create proper invoice records linked to payments

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve payment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL record the failure and allow for retry
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages
4. IF PayU returns error codes THEN the system SHALL map them to user-friendly messages
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL notify administrators appropriately

### Requirement 6: Subscription Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want successful payments to automatically activate my subscription, so that I can immediately access premium features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment is successful THEN the system SHALL activate the corresponding subscription
2. WHEN subscription is activated THEN the system SHALL update user permissions and access levels
3. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL not activate the subscription
4. IF subscription activation fails THEN the system SHALL handle the payment-subscription mismatch
5. WHEN processing refunds THEN the system SHALL properly handle subscription status changes

### Requirement 7: Testing and Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities, so that I can verify the PayU integration works correctly in all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide test utilities for PayU integration
2. WHEN testing payment flows THEN the system SHALL support mock PayU responses
3. WHEN validating hash generation THEN the system SHALL provide test cases for different scenarios
4. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about what went wrong
5. WHEN testing webhooks THEN the system SHALL simulate various PayU response scenarios

### Requirement 8: Performance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor PayU integration performance, so that I can ensure optimal payment processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing payments THEN the system SHALL track response times and success rates
2. WHEN webhooks are received THEN the system SHALL process them within acceptable time limits
3. WHEN payment volumes increase THEN the system SHALL handle the load appropriately
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
5. WHEN monitoring metrics THEN the system SHALL provide insights into payment patterns and issues
