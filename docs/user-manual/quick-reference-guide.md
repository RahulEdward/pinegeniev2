## Timeframe Recommendations

### Scalping (1m - 5m)
- Use fast indicators (RSI 9, EMA 5/10)
- Tight stops (0.5-1%)
- High frequency signals

### Day Trading (15m - 1h)
- Standard indicators (RSI 14, EMA 20/50)
- Moderate stops (1-2%)
- Balanced signal frequency

### Swing Trading (4h - 1d)
- Slower indicators (RSI 21, EMA 50/200)
- Wider stops (2-5%)
- Lower frequency, higher quality signals

## Common Fixes

### "Too many false signals"
```
"Add trend filter using 200 SMA"
"Include volume confirmation"
"Increase RSI thresholds to 25/75"
```

### "Not enough signals"
```
"Reduce RSI thresholds to 35/65"
"Use shorter moving averages"
"Remove restrictive filters"
```

### "Strategy too risky"
```
"Add 2% stop loss"
"Reduce position size to 1%"
"Add maximum drawdown limit"
```

### "Signals too late"
```
"Use faster indicators (shorter periods)"
"Add momentum confirmation"
"Use limit orders instead of market"
```
